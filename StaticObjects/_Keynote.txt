static is keyword, which makes object to be in heap, i.e. the object is accessble to all objects
static objects allows changes to it unlike const keyword

const is a keyword which doesnot allow change in variable value.

***static means is always public, i.e. it won't accept modifiers (Heap is accessible by all)
