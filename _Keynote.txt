Class is smallest unit that cannot be divided further
When class is instanciated memory block begins to occupy RAM, that is called object initilization
Object is which occpies space in RAM
Class will not be executed, method will be execute, so write always execution statements in methods 

The benefit of OOPS is Only  one i.e. Class that is only reusable:
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Inheritance (Extend Class/Interface) => Customise Existing class with own code
Polymorphism (Allow methods to exist with same name but with different parameters)(Overide=> Completely Rewrite the method)(Overload=>Selection of respective method from group methods with same name but having different parameters)
Encapsulation (All modifiers)(Helps to find complietime errors)
Abstraction (Un implemented methods)(The methods which do not have implementation)

The important Class in C# to use readily are: 

System.Collections=> Stack, Queue, List, Dictionary, ArrayList, SortedList, Dictionary, Hashtable
System.IO=>File, FileInfo, 


String Class:
`````````````
Namespace: System
Assemblies: System.Runtime.dll, mscorlib.dll, netstandard.dll


Any Programming Goes in 2 Levels:
`````````````````````````````````
1. Design Level  (Usually classes written in for purpose)
2. Implementation Level (Generally Main() Method where all the written code is been executed)
