Project => Namespace not vice versa

Every Project in visual studio represents a namespace/pacakage with project name as default namespace name

Every project should only have one Main() method, which may loacte in any nested namespaces in the project, at anywhere in csproj file scope

every project/namespace has independant properties from solution, press f4 on projectfile.csproj

Project can have any number of customized namespaces, and nested namespaces at any depth

Nested namespaces are allowed, no reference and using statements required, if namespaces are within the project

Project name will be default namespace name for every source/class.cs created and rename of project doesnot reset default namespace name.
